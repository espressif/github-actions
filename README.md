# Espressif Github Actions

[Github Actions](https://developer.github.com/actions/) developed/used by Espressif to help manage GitHub repos.

* `sync_issues_to_jira` performs one way syncing of GitHub issues into a JIRA project.
* `release_zips` creates a zip file from a tagged version to attach to a release (recursive clone, unlike the automatic GitHub source archives.)

# Support and Changes

* Raising issues and sending Pull Requests is very welcome.

* However, please remember this repository exists to serve Espressif's internal GitHub integration needs. Issues or Pull Requests which aren't useful for those needs may not be addressed or merged. Sorry.
