# Espressif Github Actions

[Github Actions](https://developer.github.com/actions/) developed by Espressif to help manage GitHub repositories.

- [sync_issues_to_jira](sync_issues_to_jira/) performs one-way syncing of GitHub issues into a JIRA project.
- [release_zips](release_zips/) creates a zip file from a tagged version to attach to a release (recursive clone, unlike the automatic GitHub source archives.)
- [upload_components](upload_components/) uploads components from a GitHub repo to [Espressif Component Service](https://components.espressif.com)

## Support and Changes

- Raising issues and sending Pull Requests is very welcome.
- However, please remember that some actions serve Espressif's internal GitHub integration needs. Issues or Pull Requests which aren't useful for those needs may not be addressed or merged. Sorry.
